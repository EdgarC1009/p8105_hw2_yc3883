# Problem 1

## Problem 1 (1)

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

1.  specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read\_excel
2.  use reasonable variable names
3.  omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
4.  round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer

``` r
trashw_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N534") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

## Problem 1 (2)

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable for year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable.

``` r
pdata_2019_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

pdata_2018_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

pdata_df = 
  bind_rows(pdata_2018_df, pdata_2019_df) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  rename(total_precipitation = total) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

For trashw\_df, the number of observation is 453. All variables in this
dataset are dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons,
volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts,
glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls,
homes\_powered. Some key variable examples are “weight\_tons” with a
mean of 3.2002208 and variance as 0.536111, “volume\_cubic\_yards” with
a mean of 15.4128035 and variance as 2.20311, and “plastic\_bottles”
with a mean of 1898.9293598 and variance as 1.0563394^{6}. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 9.

For pdata\_df, the number of observation is 24. All variables in this
dataset are year, month, total\_precipitation. “Total\_precipitation” is
the key variable here with a mean of 4.345 and variance of 8.3225826.
The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.

# Problem 2

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c(prez_gop,prez_dem),
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "presidency"
  ) %>% 
  filter(presidency != 0) %>% 
  select(-c(day, presidency)) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read.csv("data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    year = ifelse(year > 2021, year - 100, year),
    month = month.abb[month]
    ) %>% 
  rename(sp_index = close) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemploy_df = 
  read.csv("data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c(Jan:Dec),
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent_unemploy"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
union2_df = 
  full_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

union3_df = 
  full_join(union2_df, unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

For “pols\_df”, it contains year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop,
gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president, which represents the number of
governors, senators, representatives for two parties (gop = republican,
dem = democratic) on the associated date. It also indicate which party
the precident belong to.

For “snp\_df”, it contains year, month, sp\_index, which means the
closing values of the S&P stock index for the given time.

For “unemploy\_df”, it contains year, month, percent\_unemploy, which
represents the percentage of unemployment for the given time.

Resulting dataset combined three above datasets together. The dimension
of “union3\_df” is 828, 11 indicating rows and columns respectively. The
range of years is \[1947, 2015\]. Key variables are year, month,
gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president,
sp\_index, percent\_unemploy.

## Problem 3

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables changed over time; you’ll need to
address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem duplicated, and
these will need to be removed.

``` r
pbname_df = 
  read_csv("data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
         ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACI", "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"),
         ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISP", "BLACK NON HISPANIC"),
         ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP", "WHITE NON HISPANIC")) %>% 
  distinct()
```

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year.

``` r
olivia_df = 
  filter(
    pbname_df,
    gender == "FEMALE",
    childs_first_name == "olivia"
  ) %>% 
  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity, rank) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth", 
    values_from = "rank"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "childs_name_olivia_rank_overtime_female")
```

Produce a similar table showing the most popular name among male
children over time.

``` r
popular_df = 
  select(pbname_df, -count) %>% 
  filter(
    gender == "MALE",
    rank == "1"
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth",
    values_from = "childs_first_name"
  ) %>% 
  select(-c(rank, gender)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "most_popular_childs_name_overtime_male")
```

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).

``` r
whitem_df = 
  filter(
    pbname_df,
    gender == "MALE",
    ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC",
    year_of_birth == 2016
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(label = "white_male_children_name_rank_2016", aes(x = rank, y = count)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = childs_first_name), hjust = 0, vjust = 0)
```
